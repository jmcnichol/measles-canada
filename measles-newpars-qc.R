# modified measles following conversation with QC 

# thinking qs should be smaller 

# their comment on qs was: 
#It is rarely feasible to notify susceptible/exposed individuals within 2 days of exposure (this occurs, but it has been the exception rather than the norm). A more realistic timeline would be 2-3 days for notification in a stronger scenario (and this is still optimistic), and 4-5 days in a weaker scenario. We have had many instances of contact lists being received 7 days or more after exposure, but this is becoming less common with improved awareness and efficiency within the health care network. 

#Isolation of exposed contacts must begin 5 days after 1st exposure, so the effect of reaching contacts more than 72 h after first exposure but prior to the 5-day mark reduces the pool of individuals who might be eligible for PEP, but not necessarily the delay in removal by isolation. 

# The most rapidly deployed intervention we have at our disposal are text messages. These are sent within hours of obtaining a list of contacts and (now that most jurisdictions in Quebec have a process in place) would typically be received prior the start of isolation. The effectiveness of this intervention remains unknown, but is certainly expected to be inferior to that of an individual phone call (which is the next step for susceptible contacts)

# might want qs also depending on the incidence term
# like we could have , instead of beta (I + cE ) S , beta (I + cE) (fraction) S whereto E and (1- fraction) to qs 
# where soon after exposure some of the S's got taken out 
# mimicking contact tracing . that's the ones who hadn't already been infected. the others go to E. 
# but then do they qspep after that? YIKES. this would end up being a different model entirely. which i'm not sure is really worth it 


# comment about v was Highly variable by community, setting, and population. Will increase with time spent in outbreak of course. 
# but the increase comment refers to the total, not the rate, i'm sure 

# comment about qspep was PEP acceptance is generally good. We estimate PEP refusal to be inferior to 10% for the early portion of our measles response. The main issue with PEP is not reaching eligible contacts in a timely manner. This is particularly challenging for vaccine PEP, which can only be considered PEP if received within 72 hours of first exposure. Moreover, the effectiveness of PEP immunoglobulins (Ig) wanes later in the eligibility window (e.g. Ig given at day 2 is likely more effective than Ig at day 6). Finally, PEP immunoglobulins are primarily intended to protect vulnerable contacts from serious complications of the disease, and not necessarily from becoming infected (and therefore infectious). 

# comment about qi: Isolation adherence rates are difficult to estimate. The explicit refusal rate (what was said) was inferior to 1 in 5 for us, but we have no way of assessing actual adherence (what was done). 

# comment about 1/k (i had 10 days) From my reading 10 days would be the average time from exposure to infectiousness. 14 days is more commonly cited in the literature for time from exposure to rash onset.
